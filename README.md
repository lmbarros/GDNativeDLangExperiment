# GDNative in D Test/Example

A simple experiment (which also works as a simple example) on using native code written in the [D Programming Language](http://dlang.org) to power the [Godot game engine](http://godotengine.org). This makes use of the [D bindings for GDNative](https://github.com/GodotNativeTools/d_bindings).

Please see [my post about](https://stackedboxes.org/2017/08/20/trying-out-gdnative/) it for details.
